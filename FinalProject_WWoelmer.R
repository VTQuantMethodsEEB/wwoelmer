#Your final project is due on Monday May 13 by midnight. 
#The final project will be to discuss and perform a group of statistical analyses. 
#Both the scientific and statistical background should be clearly presented, and future statistical 
#steps you plan to take. These should be written and presented like the results section of a 
#scientific paper, with a full ABSTRACT, very brief introduction with a background/hypotheses, methods, 
#and discussion section sufficient for understanding the results. 
#It is acceptable to use the previously written paragraph about your data as background.
#Bullet points in the introduction, methods, and discussion section are acceptable. 
#You should think of this an outline of  a thesis paper. Usually we flesh out the results and the figures, 
#then add the rest of the stuff. I write my abstracts as a mini-outline that helps me figure out what 
#should go in each section.
#A few notes: 
#  It is perfectly fine to use a paper you are already writing, but nothing that has already been 
#sent out for peer-review please. 
# Our last day (Tuesday May 7) we will do peer review on projects.
#Title, Name and authors
#Abstract (full, ~150 â€“ 300 words, think about journals!) 
#Introduction (background, hypotheses; bulleted is okay)
#Methods (scientific and statistical; bulleted is okay)
#Results (fully written like a scientific paper)
#Please put figures in this section of paper with their captions directly below them.
#Include statistical results as 1) either in the text, 2) in main text tables, or 3) as supplemental 
#tables as you would in a real paper (more on this later).
#Discussion (what do your results mean, future statistical analyses to be conducted, 
#what this tells us about the world; bulleted is okay)
