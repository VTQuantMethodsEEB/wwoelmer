## R Markdown

The dataset I will be using in this class is a historical time series dataset of Beaverdam Reservoir a drinking water reservoir in Vinton, VA. Data has been collected by the Carey Lab on a weekly basis in the summer to a monthly basis during winter months from 2013 to present. Variables include nutrient chemistry (nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon) at the deep hole of the reservoir; water quality variables including conductivity, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll, and water temperature from the surface to the bottom of the reservoir; meteorological variables for the region including shortwave radiation, precipitation, windspeeds, and air temperature.

R script:Lesson 2 Assignment
Input data file: CTD_Meta_13_17.csv
Created data file: BVR_CTD.csv
Description: create 'bins' of CTD depth profiles, make some basic calculations


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
