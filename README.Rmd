The dataset I will be using in this class is a historical time series dataset of Beaverdam Reservoir a drinking water reservoir in Vinton, VA. Data has been collected by the Carey Lab on a weekly basis in the summer to a monthly basis during winter months from 2013 to present. Variables include nutrient chemistry (nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon) at the deep hole of the reservoir; water quality variables including conductivity, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll, and water temperature from the surface to the bottom of the reservoir; meteorological variables for the region including shortwave radiation, precipitation, windspeeds, and air temperature.
