# Hi Phillys! A few thoughts on your data. My biggest comment is to clarify what your hypotheses are and
# why you are doing the tests you are doing. The code runs great, but I was a little lost as to why you
# were doing some of the analyses and what some of the models meant. I totally understand thought that
# this is just your code and you will likely explain all of this when you do your write up for the 
# final project.
